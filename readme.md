# Nessus Enterprise Cloud Client

This is a python library for interfacing with the Tenable Nessus Enterprise Cloud scanning service. 

This library was originally made by reversing the web API as a user logged into the console. Since then, Tenable has released their v6 REST API and this module has been adjusted to work with the v6 API. 

## Status

Only a few methods are implemented; this will be updated as I use it more and need more functionality. If you are using this, send me an issue/feature request and I'll work on it.

## Sample Usage

TBD
